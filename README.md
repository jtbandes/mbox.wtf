Analyze your `.mbox` data from Google Takeout and view a size breakdown to help reclaim your Gmail storage space.

**See how much space your emails take up!**  
Upload a .mbox file (for example, an export of your Gmail data from [Google Takeout](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3024190?hl=en)). Youâ€™ll see a breakdown of storage space by `From:` address.

**Privacy? ðŸ™€**  
mbox.wtf processes your data locally and doesnâ€™t send it anywhere. In fact, _it canâ€™t_. A strict [Content Security Policy](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/?csp=https://mbox.wtf) prevents this webpage from making any network connections.
